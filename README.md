Hi! I am Pietro Lesci, a PhD student in Computer Science at Cambridge University
working on Natural Language Processing. 

Prior to starting the PhD in October 2021, I have been a senior associate in data science 
at Bain & Company in Milan, Italy, for almost 2 years. I have a background in economics 
(both BSc and MSc) and I slowly transitioned to data science and eventually to research in 
machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). I started my journey from economics to ML/data science in 2018. 

I was working towards my Msc in Economic and Social Sciences at Bocconi University. The
program focused on Frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods applied to social sciences. 
Also, the course featured many applied econometrics and time-series courses. Fascinated by
statistics in general, during the last year of my program I worked as a trainee in data science
at the Directorate of General Statistics at the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. 
I graduated in 2019 with a thesis, redacted under the supervision of Prof [Sonia Petrone](https://faculty.unibocconi.eu/soniapetrone/), 
at the intersection between statistics and deep learning
(though, leaning more towards the former): 
["Deep Learning: A Statistical Perspective"](https://github.com/pietrolesci/master_thesis). 
In the thesis I discuss the statistical interpretation of a new class of algorithms called
Neural Processes proposed a few months before.

After graduation, even more intrigued by the ML/deep learning world, I worked as a research
assistant in Natural Language Processing at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and
Analytics (BIDSA) with Prof [Dirk Hovy](https://dirkhovy.com/) in Milan, Italy. I was a member of 
the team working to understand, explore, and measure the health of conversations on the Twitter
platform - the project was completely funded by Twitter. In particular, my focus was the identification
of echo chambers and online abuse.

From March 2020 until the start of the PhD, I have been working as a data scientist in the
Advanced Analytics Group at [Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/). There, I had the chance
to work on many exciting machine learning problems across a variety of industries: telco, finance,
consumers goods, mining (!), and many others. I had the possibility to contribute to internal Python and R projects
building libraries and constructing products. And I had the great opportunity to learn how to manage
a team, set up goals and timelines, deal with tight deadlines while attaining the highest required 
quality standards for our clients. I am glad I had the chance to be supervised by 
[Diane Berry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-berry-007/) and [Marc Van Heerden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-van-heerden-b9042818/)
during the time spent there.

As of October 2021, I am a PhD student in Computer Science working on Natural Language Processing
supervised by Prof [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/). In particular, my research
focused on meta-learning and active learning methods in NLP.





First of six children, I am a passionate musician and a statistics enthusiast.
