Hi!

I am Pietro Lesci, a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge with a background in econometrics.
Broadly, I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am passionate about the science of language models: developing methods—also drawing from econometrics—to study the effect of training data on models’ behaviour. Currently, I focus on active learning, data valuation, and memorisation estimation.
