Hi!

I am Pietro Lesci, a PhD student in Computer Science at Cambridge University working on Natural Language Processing.

Prior to starting the PhD in October 2021, I have been a senior associate in data science at Bain & Company for 1.5
years. I have a background in economics (both BSc and MSc) and I slowly transitioned to data science and eventually
to research in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP).

I started my journey from economics to ML in 2018 while working as a trainee in data science at the Directorate of
General Statistics at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) in Frankfurt am Main (Germany). 
During this period, I got a formal recognition as being the only trainee to have ever developed a new procedure end-to-end, 
coordinated the expert counterparties from the National Central Banks during its implementation, and presented during regular plenary
meetings. Given my performance, I received a contract extension.

Once back from Frankfurt, I obtained a MSc in Economic and Social Sciences at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_it/albero+di+navigazione/home/corsi+di+studio/lauree+triennali/economic+and+social+sciences/) in 2019. The
course was centered on Bayesian methods for computational social sciences and featured many applied econometrics
and time-series courses. I wrote my thesis under the supervision of Prof [Sonia Petrone](https://faculty.unibocconi.eu/soniapetrone/). 
In the thesis, I discuss the statistical interpretation of a new class of algorithms called Neural Processes proposed that very same year.

After graduation, I properly entered the the ML/NLP world by working as a research assistant at the 
[Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics](https://www.bidsa.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Site/Bidsa/Home) 
with Prof [Dirk Hovy](https://dirkhovy.com/) in Milan (Italy). I was a member of the team working to understand,
explore, and measure the health of conversations on the Twitter platform - the project was completely funded by Twitter.
As part of my work at Bocconi University, I deployed two machine learning web-apps — [Wordify](https://wordify.unibocconi.it/index)
and [MACE](https://mace.unibocconi.it/) — that allow researchers
in other fields (e.g., social sciences, marketing, economics, etc) to easily access NLP tools.

From March 2020 until the start of the PhD, I have been working as a data scientist in the Advanced Analytics Group
at [Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/it/), a strategic consulting firm. There, I had the chance to work on many exciting ML/MLOps problems
across a variety of industries (telco, finance, consumers goods, mining), continents (Europe, America, Asia)
programming languages (Python, R, Julia, SQL, Rust), and use-cases (analyses, software projects, libraries, products,
and pipelines). Being Bain & Company one of the top 3 strategic consulting firms in the world, I had the great opportunity to
learn the “consultant curriculum”: managing teams, scoping work, and dealing with tight deadlines while attaining the
highest required quality standards for our clients. 
I am glad I had the chance to be managed by Dr [Diane Berry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-berry-007/) 
and [Marc Van Heerden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-van-heerden-b9042818/) during the time spent there.

I believe this is my personal added value: I worked in very diverse environments collaborating with people at different 
levels of seniority and from different cultures. I always tried to humbly give my best and often proving to be able to 
fast-learn, adapt, and succeed even in contexts that are not my own. Most importantly, I luckily managed to always leave 
with more friends than when I arrived. 

As of October 2021, I am a PhD student in Computer Science working on Natural Language Processing with
Prof [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/). I am generally interested in developing and applying 
active learning and machine teaching methodologies to solve NLP tasks in data-scarse settings.

First of six children, I am a passionate musician and a statistics enthusiast.
